The World is being invaded by #Adj1# #NounP1#
==================================
Help screamed the #Adj2# #NounS1#, we are being invaded by #Adj1# #NounP1#! They are #Verb1# everywhere!

"I can stop the #Adj1# #NounP1#!", exclaimed the #Adj3# #NounS2#. I have a #Obj1#!

The #Obj1# was made by #NounP2# in #Adj4# #Place1#. It is #Adj5#!

That won't work complained the #Adj2# #NounS1#, your #Obj1# is too #Adj6#!

The #Adj3# #NounS2#, looked at the #Obj1#. You are right #Adj2# #NounS1#.

Now we are doomed for sure.
