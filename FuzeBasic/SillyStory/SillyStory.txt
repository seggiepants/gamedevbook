There once was a #Adj1# #Adj2# person named #Name#.

#Name# wants to learn how to make #Goal#s.

In order to figure out how, #Name# decides to read the book "#Book#".

"#Book#" teaches you how to write #Noun1#s and #Verb1# text.

#Name# is glad to have the book "#Book#".

Unfortunately #Enemy# arrived in a #Vehicle# and stole the book.

#Name# had to get a trusty #Noun2# to chase the #Enemy#s.

#Name# caught up to them. Then #Name# beat up the #Enemy#s.

With the book back, #Name# can continue working on a #Goal#.

Maybe the #Goal# will incorporate #Enemy#s.
