<p>
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're 
given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. 
You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens 
another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to 
pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch doors? Lets run a simulation 
to find out.
</p>
<!-- We are going to hide the results area until we start a simulation the first time.
It just looks a bit odd otherwise. You can hide and show sections of the html dynamically 
from JavaScript.
-->
<div id="results" style="display:none">
<hr />
<h2>Results</h2>
<hr />
<p>
<div><span>Stay with original door: </span><span id="doorStay">--</span></div>
<div><span>Switch door: </span><span id="doorSwitch">--</span></div>
<progress id="barGraph" value="0" max="100"></progress>
</p>
</div>
<!-- This uses a style in the linked CSS instead of setting it manually with the 
style property like we did for the results pane. It is normally better to do 
things this way. I wanted to show both for this sample.

<div class="centered">
<button id = "startButton" onClick="StartSimulation()">Start</button>
